# A Scalable Approach to Analyze Daily Covid-19 Case Numbers Across German Federal States
The code provided analyzes and plots daily Covid-19 case numbers provided by the Rpbert Koch Institut (RKI) across all German federal states during the (former) pandemic.

In order to automate this it uses a dictionary data structure combined with a loop (using the .items() method). As a result, this approach is highly scalable and can be applied to smaller units (such as cities and counties).

 Result: No more copying and pasting of code. I hope this is helpful for you:-)
