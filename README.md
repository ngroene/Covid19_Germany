# Covid19_Germany
Analyzes and plots daily Covid-19 case numbers across all German federal states.

In order to automate this it uses a dictionary data structure combined with a loop (using the .items() method). As a result, this approach is highly scalable and can be applied to smaller units (such as cities and counties).

 No more copying and pasting of code:-)
